<h1>Hair Products</h1>
	<p> These products are the key to a fierce and hydrated hairstyle. To see how these products are used, see our <a href= "nathair3.html"> Wash Day Routine</a>.</p>

<h2>For scalp care (Choose one or a combination.)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Hollywood Beauty Tea Tree Oil Mix</b> - Tea tree oil is an amazing product that eliminates flaky skin and prevents the scalp from flaking.</li>
		<li><b>Coconut oil</b> - One application of coconut oil may last throughout the week. </li>
		<li><b>Aloe vera juice</b> - Moisturizes and strengthens hair shafts as well as the scalp. Aloe vera juice must be applied daily or several times a week in the winter months, since this is a liquid and will dry quickly in colder temperatures. In warmer temperatures, aloe vera can be applied twice a week.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>Moisture for the hair shaft (choose all)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>A leave-in conditioner of your choice</b> - A very popular leave-in conditioner is Mane Choice 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner. This product smoothes out the hair, eliminates frizz, and lasts for a few days, even in extreme temperatures. Although finding the best leave-in for your hair takes quite a bit of trial-and-error, the perfect match will decrease the amount of time spent styling and allow your curls to be their healthiest.</li>
		<li><b>Water</b> - Water is the base for every hairstyle. Some people like to combine water and aloe vera juice or water with leave-in conditioner as their base.</li>
		<li><b>Aloe vera gel or juice</b> - This can be used after water or with a water mix, as specified above. Aloe strengthens the hair shaft, reducing breakage and preserving the ends of the hair.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>For protection and strength (Choose one or a combination.)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Shea butter base</b> - Shea butter has been used for centuries by Africans as an oil for cooking, a sweetener, and for skin and hair care. Shea butter protects the hair from outside elements like the wind or even clothing. Its thickness keeps the water, aloe and leave-in conditioner from evaporating from the hair shaft during the day.</li>
		<li><b>Coconut oil</b> - Those who do not like the thick texture of shea butter will prefer coconut oil. Coconut oil is lighter, absorbs easier without having to be blended, and is less greasy in warmer temperatures. Because it is not as thick as shea butter, it needs to be re-applied more frequently.</li>
		<li><b>Argan oil</b> - Also known as Moroccan oil, this lightweight oil is known to strengthen the hair which prevents breakage. It also allows hair strands to group together, creating defined curls on even the kinkiest hair types. In the United States of America, argan is expensive and is often mixed with other oils. However, it can be as cheap as $5 USD in Europe, Asia, and Africa.</li>
		<li><b>Avocado oil</b> - This lightweight oil will add nutrients to your hair shaft.</li>
		<li><b>Jojoba oil</b> - Jojoba oil will get rid of frizzy hairs and give that shine.</li>
		<li><b>Vitamin E</b> - Many hair vitamins include vitamin E as an ingredient. This vitamin prevents breakage and hair loss while expanding thin hairs.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>For wash day (Choose one or a combination.)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Shampoo</b> - Shampoo clarifies the hair, removing oils, dirt, and products that have accumulated over time. This keeps the scalp clean and free of grime. A good shampoo will clear the scalp without being harsh on the hair and causing breakage.</li>
		<li><b>Conditioner</b> - Conditioner restores the nutrients that the shampoo has washed away, preventing the hair from becoming dry and brittle for too long. Suggestion: Tresemme</li>
		<li><b>Oil Mix</b> - A mix of essential oils will keep the leave-in conditioner, water, and aloe vera from evaporating from the hair within a few hours. It also softens the hair and adds natural vitamins.</li>
		<li><b>Towel</b> - Regular towels from the bath section of department stores will cause hair to break and snag. Satin towels or microfiber towels will protect those hair strands and help the hair to dry evenly.</li>
		<li><b>Blowdryer</b> - A good blowdryer will speed up the after-wash drying process. They are relatively safe and will not dry the hair shaft too much as long as the lower settings are used. Suggestion: Revlon One-Step Hairdrying Square Brush. <b>*Remember to use a heat protectant spray before using any heat products.*</b></li>
		<li><b>Wide toothed comb or a hair pick for detangling</b> - Whether detangling on dry or wet hair, the tool being used is very important. Find one that feels good in your hand. No matter which option you choose, you need to be gentle and detangle slowly to minimize hair loss.</li>
		<li><b>Boar bristle hair brush or square brush</b> - This tool can be used for detangling along with the comb or hair pick. Brushes can detangle a larger section of hair at once and can be used to neaten the hair or edges. It is not the best option for hair that is very tangled.</li>
		<li><b>Duck bill hair clips</b> - Hair clips will cut your styling and detangling time by more than half by keeping your sections neat and organized as you work your way through.</li>
