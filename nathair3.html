<h1>Wash Day Routine</h1>
	
<p>Washing your natural hair doesn't have to be difficult or take forever or...(choose any one of the negative words that are used to describe natural hair)! Follow this simple night-time routine to ensure that your curls pop.</p>
<ol class = "steps">
	<li>Remove all headbands, hairbands, and bobby pins from your hair.</li>
	<li>Optional: Before getting in the shower, use a spray bottle full of water to make your hair slightly damp. Pour a handful of aloe vera gel or juice into a small bowl and add it to your hair little by little. Set a timer for 15 minutes, and then continue with the next steps.</li>
	<li>In the shower, shampoo your hair, focusing on the scalp and adding very little shampoo to the hair strands. Rinse. Repeat if your scalp feels greasy or flaky.</li>
	<li>Apply enough conditioner to your hair to coat each strand, then wait two to four minutes before rinsing.</li>
	<li>Once your shower is completed, dry your hair using an old cotton t-shirt, then allow it to air-dry until it is damp (not dry).</li>
	<li>Part your hair into five sections and use banana clips to keep each section separate as you work through the hair.</li>
	<li> Take the first section, which will be on your forehead.</li>
	<li>Apply leave-in conditioner; not enough to leave a residue once it dries, but not so little that your hair will be brittle and dry in a few hours.</li>
	<li>After working it through the hair, detangle the section using your choice of detangling tool or fingers.</li>
	<li>Add a cream, preferably one that is shea butter-based.</li>
	<li>Add a blend of essential oils.</li>
	<li>Split the section into three strands of hair and braid it.</li>
	<li>Continue with all five sections of hair.</li>
	<li>Place your hair in a silk bonnet or scarf to air-dry overnight.</li>
	<li>In the morning, take down the braids, separate the strands to make your fro look full, and you're done!</li>
</ol>

	<p>Once you have the hang of this routine, it shouldn't take you more than an hour and a half which is not bad since this is not done every single night.</p>
