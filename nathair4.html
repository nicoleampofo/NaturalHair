	<h1>Night Time Routine</h1>
<p>How do you sleep? On your left side, or right side? With the window slightly open or closed? Styling your hair for the following day can become another preference of your choosing. This method takes no more than 10 minutes once mastered.</p>
	<ol class = "steps">
		<li>Separate your hair into five equal sections using a long tailed comb. The front section should be in the front as if you had bangs. Keep the sections separated with large duck-billed hair clips.</li>
		<li>In the first section, dampen the hair slightly with water.</li>
		<li>Apply your leave-in conditioner.</li>
		<li>Comb the section out with a hair pick or wide-tooth comb.</li>
		<li>Add a hair cream.</li>
		<li>Add hair oils.</li>
		<li>Braid the hair into a three-strand braid.</li>
		<li>Repeat on all five sections.</li>
		<li>Put a satin bonnet or scarf over the hair for the night and go to sleep.</li>
		<li>In the morning, take down each braid and separate each of the three strands until you have a juicy afro.</li>
	</ol>
<p>If you would like a lower-maintanance morning routine, keep the braids in for up to seven days, keeping it covered in a head wrap during the day.</p>
