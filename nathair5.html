  <h1>Styles to Try</h1>

  <p>Here are some hairstyles for inspiration.</p>
  <h2>The Afro</h2>
  <p>This timeless hairstyle can be achieved with just a leave in conditioner and water. See <a href = "nathair4.html">Night Time Routine</a> for details on how to achieve this effortless look.</p>
  <h2>Crown Updo</h2>
  <p>The crown updo is obtained by sectioning off the front part of the hair, where bangs would be. This section is flat-twisted to the side of the head. The rest of the hair is gathered into a ponytail and the tail of the flat twist is bobby pinned to the side of the updo.</p>
  <h2>Mini Twists</h2>
  <p>Mini twists are one of the most low-maintenance hairstyle that does not require much upkeep. Using a leave-in conditioner, sealing cream, and essential oils, separate your hair into small sections and twist to the end. Let the hair air-dry and sleep with a satin bonnet or scarf. The style can be kept for two to four weeks depending on the size of the twists. Smaller twists will last longer.</p>
